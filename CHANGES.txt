========================

V1.1
----
11/6/2013
==========
-Added this file to make tracking changes easier

-Added support for versions of Android after and including 1.5.

-Added checking for if the user doesn't have an accelerometer
 installed and can't use the accelerometer test.
 
-In a related note, added <uses-feature> tags to the application
 manifest for accelerometer and portrait mode. I didn't know this was
 an option, and I definitely should've added it sooner to make the app more
 compatible with more devices. Ugh... next time :-)
 
-Decided to can the settings features with math/age levels. While it was a good
 idea in theory, I couldn't come up with a clean and easy way to implement it, and
 it was holding me back from working more on the project. I think I've cleared out
 all the files/etc. I was using or intending to use for settings stuff, but I might have
 left some in, resulting in errors/inefficiencies - if you see anything like that, please
 contact me so I can rectify the issue and release a patch.
 
-Expanded the section on Accelerometers in the Kinematics section: added a "General Accelerometers"
 page that led to the Accelerometer Test and a new "Accelerometer Info" page with a diagram and
 some information on accelerometers.
 
-Fixed some formatting to make the app look more consistent
